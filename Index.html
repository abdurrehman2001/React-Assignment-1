            <h2>React</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets
                you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. We'll get to the
                funny XML-like tags soon. ... When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our
                components.</p>

            <h2>SPA v/s MPA</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Single-page web apps have existed for almost twenty years already, but their popularity is relatively
                new. The reason for that is technological development: current technology allows developers to turn what
                used to be major drawbacks into workable solutions or even benefits. In this article, we’ll talk about
                the differences between single page applications and multi-page applications and which to choose for
                your business.
                <br>
                The single page application (SPA) vs multi page application (MPA) battle is more complex than it seems.
                Let’s take a close look at all the pros and cons of each type of web application.

            <h2>React v/s Angular</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The slowest of the big three, React also has fewer out-of-the-box features than the others. It does have
                built-in protection against cross-scripting attacks, however, and it’s developed and used by Facebook.
                React is the most popular JavaScript framework today.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Angular has lengthy code but the most built-in features, so it requires fewer extra technologies in your
                stack than React or Vue. Developed and used by Google, Angular is the second most popular JS framework.

            <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Virtual DOM
                The Virtual DOM is a light-weight abstraction of the DOM. You can think of it as a copy of the DOM, that
                can be updated without affecting the actual DOM. It has all the same properties as the real DOM object,
                but doesn’t have the ability to write to the screen like the real DOM</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Dom</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>“The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs
                and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.”</p>
        </div>
        <!-- <div>

        <div>
            <h2>One-way data binding</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>One-way data-binding means the data flows in a single direction so that whenever the data changes in a
                component, it also updates the view with new data.Have you seen in the above image the data property we
                defined inside the app.component.ts file is
                connected to the html template by using {{}} syntax.
                <br>
                Now if we change the title property inside app.component.ts file our view also updates with the new
                change this is called one-way data binding
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Two-way data binding</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Two-way data binding means data flows in both directions, it means any change happens in the view updates
                the data and any change happens in the data updates the view.
                <br>
                In angular, by using ngModel directive we can create two-way data binding.In the above image, we have
                connected the data property title to the input element by using ngModel directive.
